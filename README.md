Objective of the project is to be built a software/microservice for filtering online news. The key feature of it is to filter, sort and evaluate for short period of time all the articles in the digital environment. Nowadays they are a vast volume of news, published by different resources varying in large number of topics. As the user may not interested in every topic there is a need of a system which is able to represent only essential results of the engine findings. The accurate outcome of the news exploration is not the only benefit that the system will provide, a short response time is another. The microservice is to be beneficial for the end users with time saving because the software is designed to visualise only the exact results that the user is keen on. 
Deliverables of the study are but not limited to complete working system with integrated search engine, personal account set up, editing profile preferences, adding new categories to the profile, unsubscribe from notifications if the topic is no longer relevant to the user.
